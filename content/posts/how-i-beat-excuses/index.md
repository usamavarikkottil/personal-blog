# How do I beat Excuses: a neat trick
I am going to share a small secret trick I used to achieve my goals regardless of any excuses that I have.

### Why do I fail at executing a Plan
Every Human being who wants to be successful knows that he should set Goals. Setting Goals are necessary for every little things. Whether it may be starting a business, becoming an influencer, gaining a new skill, or anything like that. Sometimes we unknowingly set Goals and achieve those certain things we want to achieve. But most times we would plan to do something/set goals that we know we want to achieve the Goal. But later find an excuse to stop that before even tring to start working on the goal (and fail at executing them) . 
I have seen many times people wish to do something, then step back by finding an excuse. "I'm not that type of person", "I don't have  enough time", "I don't have money or certain resources", "I don't have any knowledge in this specific field".

The truth is that setting goal or planning somethinng is Easy. However executing them or doing something consistently is really hard. Harder than we think(plan). There is no magic button to execute the plan.

But I can surely say that failing to execute a plan is due to/all about mentality. We fail at setting right mindset most times. So we can say that failing to achieve a goal, or executing a plan, is not because of anything wrong in your plan/goal, or anything wrong in you, it is because something is wrong in the way you treat your goal/plan. Let's see how do I treat my goals and excuses, So should you.

### My Goals & Excuses: How do I treat them 
Whenever I set a goal or plan something to do, there's a lot more than a goal to do. Later these extra things become excuses and the goal will fail at that certain excuse point.
Suppose If I want to start an online business. I don't have enough fund to hire any employee. Nor do I know to build an online business website. Normally in this scenario I have 2 excuses to put forward. "I don't know to build a website for my Business", and "I don't have money to hire a website developer to build a website for me".

In any case If somebody asks me about the status of my online business, I can say these two excuses to them today. Even after 6 months they ask me again I can repeat both these excuses again. And even if they ask me One year later, I can put these excuses forward.

This is how i fail at on my goals most time. However this is not the way successfull people take excuses. Let's treat these excuses in a different manner.

What I had done here is that assign sub goals. My main goal is starting an online business. And Instead of stopping the goal after finding an excuse, I had retreated the excuse making it as a sub goal, if I spend two or three hours per day it will only require me less than a month to complete the sub goal #1, and build a basic website to start off my business. Working for sub goal for one month is a lot better than repeating the same excuse for years.

Let's take example #2.
suppose if I want to become an Instagram Influencer. Eventhough I have some basic camera accessories, I don't know to use thaccessories properly, or I am not an expert in using all the features, and neat tricks of Instagram. Nor do I know  to takgood pose. However, I wish if I have post good pictures and get a ton of likes. If this is the case, normally I would step afrom this goal by making those two or three excuses.

These three excuses are simple ones. If I would consider setting those excuses as sub goals and start working to accomplish these goals by watching tutorials and practice these, I would only need a few weeks to start posting good contents into Instagram.
However, If I make it as excuses, it will last forever as excuses.

In another case(non-realistic), suppose I I don't have any previous knowledge in Mathematics. I don't know anything like addition, substraction,  multiplication, division, or anything like that. I don't even know these systems were existed. But now I have my goal to learn division . What would happen in this case if I'm an excuse boy. I would probably step away from my "division learning" goal by putting multiple excuses.

Look at another example. If I want to start a new habit. Let's just say, for example Reading. Eventhough I know reading daily is necessary for every good human being, I find some excuses on starting the habit and stay away from reading. The excuse may be "I don't have time", "I'm not that type of person", "I forget to read on most days", "I don't like it", or anything maybe.

Every time you make an excuse, remember that you are actually ruining the "Future You". So start treating excuses as Tasks.
Take a paper, right at the moment and list down your goals and excuses. Then Change that excuses into Tasks. And please atleast this time don't make an excuse and postpone this to later.

once we begin to write down the excuse tasks, It will get longer later. However that's still a huge progress. Because we know atleast what we want to do to get there. Where this was not the case before.
