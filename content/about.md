This is me looking into my Laptop.


I love to code, hack, and explore new ideas.

I have developed web apps in MERN Stack(MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). A few of them are shown in [projects](/projects) page.

In my free time, I love finding bugs in web applications, and some companies pay me for that.

Along with web dev and security, I have a keen interest in entrepreneurship. I don't know why, but i have already made some of my ideas into action. I started taking my first steps into this journey just a few weeks before.
