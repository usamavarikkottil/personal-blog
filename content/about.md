#### I love to `code`, `hack`, and explore new `ideas`. 

I have developed web apps in **MERN** Stack(MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). A few of them are shown in [projects](/projects) page.

In my spare time, I love finding bugs in web applications, and some companies pay me for that.

 Along with **web dev** and **security**, I have a keen interest in **entrepreneurship**. I started taking my first steps into this journey just a few weeks before.

### The other half of me

As a Human, I love to spend my time being myself. This makes me more productive. Instead of spending my whole life with computers, I enjoy doing other personal things. Travelling, Trekking, Swimming, Cycling, Chilling with friends, Playing with pets, Making Humans smile are a few of them.

I mostly get addicted to traveling solo. Every time I travel Solo, I get addicted more into it. But the truth is I rarely get a chance to Travel Solo. While traveling, I enjoy Interacting with random people, getting them as good friends, Living in small villages, Sleeping in Railway stations or Bus stands(yeah! seriously ðŸ¤“), Trekking on mountains, Walking for a long distance, being a guest for a random person, such, such and such... I enjoy every moment during the trip.
